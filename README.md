### Providing a distributed file storage for German Schul-Cloud
One of the major purposes of German Schul-Cloud is to make various teaching materials accessible to everyone and to make them available on several devices. It should be possible to share files collaboratively and use them in lessons without additional software.

The goal of the present Bachelor thesis was to design a distributed and flexible file storage for the Schul-Cloud. Existing file storage providers have been evaluated, studies in the area of digital learning have been checked and a dynamic concept for a file storage has been developed. Several implementations in the current Schul-Cloud server and client have been presented and compared with other solutions. In addition, a number of connectivity options for file management were enumerated.

This thesis is written in German.
